# AGENT Instructions

These guidelines help maintainers and automated agents work consistently in this repository.

- Run `./gradlew test` before submitting a pull request that modifies source code or documentation.
- Mention key file paths in PR summaries using the format `F:<file_path>` when referencing specific code or docs.
- If build or test commands fail because dependencies cannot be fetched, note this in the PR description.
